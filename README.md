# COVID-19_Viz_DONTUSEFORDECISIONMAKING
A personal, very simple data cleaning and visualization project not meant for decision-making.

I am tracking progress online for simpler future access but please do not use this for decision-making. I have no training in epidemiology or policy at any level. 

## Data Credit
Initial data came from the Johns Hopkins Center for Systems Science and Engineering data scrapimg and visualization project: https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19.

Updates on 29-Mar-2020:
- Began pulling in data on countywide (USA only) COVID-19 confirmed cases from USAFacts.org, specifically https://usafacts.org/visualizations/coronavirus-covid-19-spread-map/
- USA county geographic data (lat/lon/area) from https://www.weather.gov/gis/Counties
- USA county populations from https://data.healthcare.gov/dataset/Geocodes-USA-with-Counties/52wv-g36k
